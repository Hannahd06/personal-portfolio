        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-main">I was born and raised in California. I am currently working on completing my bachelor's degree in Web Development. 
                 I am working towards building a career helping to create websites that are fun and unique and tailored to providing positive user experiences.
            </p>

            <p> When I am not working or studying, I enjoy drawing. Since I was a child, I have had a passion for doodling and sketching.
               I enjoy creating both traditional and digital art, mostly on Procreate.
                While I enjoy making and sharing my work, I always feel self-conscious because I am not confident in my abilities.
                However, it brings me joy when others enjoy my work.
                 My proudest achievements as an artist was this past year, when I shared one of my fan arts for my favorite musician on social media and they really loved it!

            <p>I love music. Over the past few years, I discovered and fell in love with the K-pop genre. 
                I was stunned by the complexity and creativity that comes with each group and impressed by the hard-work and dedication it takes to commit to being an idol. It's quite fascinating.
                I love that the K-pop fan base reaches a variety fans from all kinds of backgrounds and age ranges. 
                I am grateful because it has helped me to open up a little more and continue to gain more confidence in myself. 
                I love attending concerts and over past few years I have been able to see some amazing shows and makes some great friends.
                I look forward to the possibility of making more memorable experiences.
